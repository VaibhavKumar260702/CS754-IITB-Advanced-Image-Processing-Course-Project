About the files:

---------------- Function file--------------------------------- 

-> biased_unbiased_estimator: output biased and unbaised covariance matrix given the input is X,m,s described in fucntion.




--------------Implementation on Datasets---------------------------

->Gen4_Code: implements the biased_unbiased_estimator on Gen4 dataset and provides accuracy plot and computation time plot.
->Mnist_Code: implements the biased_unbiased_estimator on Mnist dataset and provides accuracy plot and computation time plot.
->Traffic_Code: implements the biased_unbiased_estimator on Traffic dataset and provides accuracy plot and computation time plot.


--------------Reconstructions--------------------------

-> Mnist_reconstruction: reconstructs image using first eigen vector of unbaised estimator for gamma=0.1,0.3,0.5 and for full data 
->Traffic_reconstruction: reconstructs image using first eigen vector of unbaised estimator for gamma=0.1,0.3,0.5 and for full data


-----------Original Instances of Datasets-----------------

->Instances_Dataset: shows some original instances of mnist and traffic dataset
